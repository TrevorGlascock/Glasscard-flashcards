# Project_Flashcards
WIP Full-Stack React Flashcard app


**### TODO:**
- Debug unexpected failing tests _(Perhaps my new way of rendering broke a few that were already passing)_.
- Need to add cleanup functions to each of the useEffectHooks to prevent data leaks.
- Refactor for comments and readability.
- Separate FormTemplate into DRY and readable subcomponents
- Add personal flair and color scheme to the project and clean up it's style.
- Turn the loading message into a buffering animation.
